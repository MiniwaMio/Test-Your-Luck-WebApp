# Test Your Luck WebApp by MTech

## 1. Introduction

Hi, This is Miniwa from MTech.  
This is one of the many projects that I will be making to learn the Postgres, Express, React, Node (PERN Stack).

## 2. Game Mechanics

Test Your Luck is a simple web game that assigns a 4 digit hidden number every day and each player will get 5 attempts per day to guess the correct number.  
If you successfully guessed a number. CONGRATULATIONS!! You are lucky!! You get a point!!  
If you didn't, try again tomorrow.

There will be leaderboard so you can boast to your friends that you are indeed lucky. :>
